# CryptoClustering
Challenge19

The work is divided into the following subsections:

1. Prepare the Data
2. Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame
3. Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data
4. Optimise Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
5. Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data
6. Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data
7. Visualise and Compare the Results

General Analysis of Data: 

About 89.5% of the total variance is condensed into the 3 PCA variables. 
Both of the Elbow Charts are very similar and suggest using 4 clusters. 
There are 2 coins that fall on their own cluster (namely Celsius-Degree-Token and Ethlend). The rest of the coins fall in one of 2 groups.
